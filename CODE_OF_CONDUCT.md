# Friday 11am Group 2 Code of Conduct
This document outlines the expectations for professionalism, collaboration, and respect within our group.
Adherence to this code ensures a productive and positive working environment for everyone.

## 1. Core Values & Respect
- **Be Respectful:** Treat all team members, their ideas, and their time with respect, regardless of background or experience level
- **Be Inclusive:** Foster an environment where everyone feels safe, welcome, and encouraged to contribute equally. No idea too small. 
- **Share Knowledge:** Help team members who are struggling. We succeed as a team, not as individuals.
- **Zero Tolerance:** Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language will not be tolerated.

## 2. Communication Guidelines
- **Be Clear & Timely:**
- **Structured Meetings:**
- **Document Decisions:**
- **Tone Check:**

## 3. Coding Standards & Collaboration
- **Agree on Standards:**
- **Use Version Control (Git):**
  - Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
  - Create separate branches for all new features or bug fixes. **Never commit directly to the main/master branch.**
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
  - Do not push broken or untested code.
- **Code Review:** Review and approve at least one other team member's Pull Request (PR) before merging. Provide constructive, kind, and specific feedback.
- **Comment Your Code:** Include comments for complex logic, public functions, and configuration settings.

## 4. Project Management & Deadlines
- **Own Your Tasks:** Take responsibility for assigned tasks, updating the status (e.g. GitHub Issues) regulary.
- **Estimate Realistically:** Be honest about how long a task will take. It's better to deliver slightly early than significantly late.
- **Communicate Delays Early:** If you anticipate missing a deadline, inform the group immediately so we can adjust the plan. Do not wait until the deadline has passed.
- **Quality Over Speed** Ensure your work is complete and tested before marking it as done.

## 5. Conflict Resolution Process
1. **Direct Discussion:** The parties involved should first attempt to resolve the issue directly and privately.
2. **Group Interventaion:** If resolution isn't possible, bring the issue to the entire group for mediation.
3. **Escalation:** If the issue still persists and affects the project's progress, the team will collectively seek guidance from the module delivery team.

### **Agreement:** By continuing to work on this project, all members agree to adhere to this Code of Conduct.
